# Deep Serialize Form Data

Form serializer capable of handling nested data and arrays. Based largely from
Ben Alman's De-param function from the JQuery BBQ plugin, but altered to
have no jQuery dependencies, and convert FormData into javascript objects,
instead of query parameters.

## Installation

 ```bash
 $ yarn add deep-serialize-form
 ```

## Usage

Modular Javascript:

```javascript
> import { deepSerializeForm } from 'deep-serialize-form'
```

Include Directly:

```html
> <script src="/deep-serialize-form.min.js"></script>
```

Usage:
```javascript
> const form = document.getElementById('form');
> const data = deepSerializeForm(form);
> console.log(data);
```
